# Flutter Comprehensive GoRouter Example

This repository demonstrates the use of GoRouter in Flutter for advanced routing scenarios. Each branch in this repository covers a specific aspect of routing, making it easier for developers to understand and implement similar functionalities in their own applications.

## Branches Overview

Each link below leads directly to a branch showcasing a specific routing concept implemented with GoRouter in Flutter:

- [main](https://github.com/khkred/flutter_comp_go_router/tree/main) - The main branch contains the initial setup and configuration for using GoRouter in a Flutter application.
- [starter-code](https://github.com/khkred/flutter_comp_go_router/tree/starter-code) - Starter code with basic setup before adding specific routing features.
- [declarative-routing](https://github.com/khkred/flutter_comp_go_router/tree/declarative-routing) - Demonstrates how to implement declarative routing using GoRouter.
